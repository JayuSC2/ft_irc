IRC         Internet Relay Standard 

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) uses a client-server architecture:
Clients connect to a central server to send/receive real-time messages.
All communication is relayed by the server, allowing users in the same channel to communicate.

IRC is decentralized and not controlled by any single company.

Features to consider: 
    Accepting multiple client connections
    Relaying messages between clients
    Managing channels and user sessions
    No message history is stored on the server — it's a real-time communication platform.
    "Non-blocking socket server" to handle real-time client communication

Clients connect to the server using commands:
    /join channelname       join or create a channel
    /nick username          set or change nickname

The server has to listen on specific ports (usually TCP port 6667).

Define user classes — e.g., regular users vs. operators, with varying privileges.


There is a sub-IRC protocol called  DCC (Direct Client-to-Client) is a sub-protocol used for:
    Sending files or private chats directly between clients, bypassing the server
    The server only helps exchange IP addresses between the two clients
