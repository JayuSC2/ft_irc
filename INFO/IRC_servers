IRC         Internet Relay Standard 

It's a basic real-time chat server

General idea
Standard client-server setup: Run a client on your PC, connect client to a server and then everyone else connected to this server can communicate with each other in real-time.
"Relayed" by the server. 
It is independent from any company, which is why many people perfer to use it. Even during blackout in the past, the news companies used IRC to communicate.

To set it up
could use virtual private server
have to specify which ports to listen at
which user classes to specify - privileges, ...

No info is stored at server level

/join #servername       to connect to the server
/nick username          to specify username

can send files directly from one user to another without passing through the server 
There is a sub-IRC protocol called DCC (Direct Client To Client)
IRC server knows IP of user1 and IP of user2 => if both want to exchange info then it just passes it along instead of having to upload the file to the server.
