High-Level Architecture

1. Networking Layer
    TCP socket server (AF_INET)
        Socket = endpoint for sending/receiving data over a network.
        A TCP socket is created using:
            int server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
            AF_INET = IPv4
            SOCK_STREAM = TCP

    fcntl() to set sockets to non-blocking
    poll() loop to handle:
        Listening socket (accept new clients)
        Client sockets (read/write)

2. Parser / Command Processor
    Buffer client input until newline
    Parse and tokenize lines
    Match and dispatch to command handlers

3. "ClientState" Class which consists of 
    Socket FD
    Nickname
    Username
    Authentication status
    Joined channels
    Operator status in channels

4. "ChannelState" Class which consists of 
    Name
    Topic
    Members (Client class - objects)
    Operators
    Modes (i, t, k, o, l)
    Key/password
    User limit
