High-Level Architecture

// create a socket server for an IRC server
// bind the socket to an IP/port
// Mark the socket for listening incoming connections
// Accept incoming connections
// Create a poll loop to handle multiple clients
// while receiving - display messages from clients and echo them back
// Send responses to clients
// Close connections when clients disconnect
// Handle errors and edge cases
// close socket

1. Networking Layer
    TCP socket server (AF_INET)
        Socket = endpoint for sending/receiving data over a network.
        A TCP socket is created using:
            int server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
            AF_INET = IPv4
            SOCK_STREAM = TCP

    fcntl() to set sockets to non-blocking
    poll() loop to handle:
        Listening socket (accept new clients)
        Client sockets (read/write)

2. Parser / Command Processor
    Buffer client input until newline
    Parse and tokenize lines
    Match and dispatch to command handlers

3. "ClientState" Class which consists of 
    Socket FD
    Nickname
    Username
    Authentication status
    Joined channels
    Operator status in channels

4. "ChannelState" Class which consists of 
    Name
    Topic
    Members (Client class - objects)
    Operators
    Modes (i, t, k, o, l)
    Key/password
    User limit

_________________

 1. Networking & I/O Person
Responsibilities:
    Set up the TCP socket server
    Implement non-blocking sockets using fcntl()
    Handle poll() loop for I/O multiplexing
    Accept new client connections
    Manage disconnects and errors

Example tasks:
    socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), poll()
    Connection timeout handling
    Managing the file descriptors and main server loop

2. Parser & Command Logic Person
    Responsibilities:

    Implement input buffering and command tokenization
    Handle IRC commands (NICK, USER, JOIN, PRIVMSG, etc.)
    Enforce protocol syntax and state transitions (e.g., authentication)
    Example tasks:
        Build a command dispatcher
        Write a nickname parser and validator
        Respond to commands and update client state

3. State Management & Channel Logic Person
Responsibilities:
    Create Client and Channel classes (e.g. ClientState, ChannelState)
    Manage user data, authentication, operator status
    Handle channels, membership, and channel modes (+i, +t, etc.)

Example tasks:
    Channel join/part logic
    Channel mode and operator control
    Data structures for managing users and channels
